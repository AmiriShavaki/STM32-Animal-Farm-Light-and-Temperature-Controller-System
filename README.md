The MCU reads the LM35 and LDR sensors frequently and turn on/off cooler, heater and LED lights based on their values. It also has ability to set a timer which on specific elapsed time from the beginning turns on the lights regardless of LDR.

## Softwares:
+ Keil uVision 5
+ STM32 Cube MX
+ Proteus 8.6

## Peripherals:
+ **MCU:** STM32F103C4
+ **Temperature Sensor:** LM35
+ **Light Intensity Sensor:** LDR
+ **LCD:** LM041L
